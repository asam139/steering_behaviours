# steering_behaviours

Steering behaviours aim to help autonomous characters move in a realistic manner, 
by using simple forces that are combined to produce life-like, 
improvisational navigation around the characters' environment. 

They are not based on complex strategies involving path planning or global calculations, 
but instead use local information, such as neighbours forces. 
This makes them simple to understand and implement, 
but still able to produce very complex movement patterns.
